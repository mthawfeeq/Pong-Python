# Pong-Python

- Implemented the classic Arcade game Pong using the Turtle class in Python.
- Simultaneous control of both ends (W and S keys for the left paddle, UP and DOWN keys for the right paddle). 
- Made entirely using Object Oriented Programming approach as opposed to the Procedural style of programming.
- Everytime the ball hits either paddle, the speed of the ball increases to engage user in the gameplay. 
- The game ends when the ball goes past the paddles on either end (the ball will be brought back to the center position and pushed in the opposite direction from the previous time).
